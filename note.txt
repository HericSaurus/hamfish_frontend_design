Might want tinker with mid size screen on navbar, maybe toggle or not to toggle



To change to a different breakpoint, weâ€™d just need to swap out navbar-expand-md with one of these..

navbar-expand = never collapses vertically (remains horizontal)
navbar-expand-sm = collapses below sm widths <576px
navbar-expand-md = collapses below md widths <768px
navbar-expand-lg = collapses below lg widths <992px
navbar-expand-xl = collapses below xl widths <1200px
